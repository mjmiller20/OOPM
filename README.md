## Project Description
### Problem
*Car Rental Company* currently uses a manual entry database system, where customers submit a form online, and a representative must manually review the submission and enter the information into their database.  This uses up a lot of valuable time of the representatives, as they have to spend so many hours reviewing rental submissions, looking for available rentals, and communicating with customers.  The company has requested a system instead that will accept the requested rental information from the customer and will automatically show rentals that fit their criteria, allowing the customer to book their rental in real time.  On the back-end, the company's database of available car rentals will also automatically be updated when a customer creates a reservation, allowing the rental company representatives to spend their time in more useful areas.

### Solution
Our group's solution involves a custom database and python application.  The application will allow customers to create an account/login to their account with the rental company, create new reservations, and view their current/upcoming reservations.

### Requirements
Detailed product requirements can be found in the document labeled "RequirementsDoc.docx".

### Process
Our team has opted to work in an Agile environment.  Due to scheduling constraints between team members, we have elected to not meet for a daily scrum, but instead meet every 2 weeks for a sprint planning/retrospective meeting.  During this biweekly meeting, the team discusses our individual work during that 2-week sprint, as well as what each member will complete during the next 2-week sprint.  The team also engages in continued online communication through our Discord group channel.
