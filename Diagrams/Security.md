This code implements a security design plan for the project.

The security design plan includes the following measures:
- Authentication: Implementing a secure authentication mechanism to ensure only authorized users can access the system.
- Authorization: Defining roles and permissions to control access to different parts of the system based on user privileges.
- Input validation: Implementing input validation techniques to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Data encryption: Encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit to protect it from unauthorized access.
- Error handling: Implementing proper error handling mechanisms to prevent information leakage and provide a secure user experience.
- Logging and monitoring: Implementing logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to security incidents in a timely manner.
- Regular security updates: Keeping the system up to date with the latest security patches and updates to address any known vulnerabilities.

By following this security design plan, the project aims to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its data, protecting it from potential security threats.
